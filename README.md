[b]Currently messed up a line or two in my code so only works via ace interaction[/b]

[b]Call For Fire Reference Card[/b]
This mod introduces a card thats always available that contains the necessary information to be transmitted for quick and accurate fire mission. The cards designed to be client side and works similarly to the ACE3 Range Card.

[b]How do I access it?[/b]
The card is accessed either through a user-assigned keybinding via Controls > Configure Addons > Call For Fire Card
OR
You can make it appear in the ACE Self-Interaction Menu > Equipment > Call fo Fire Card > Open Reference Card by enabling this through CBA addon options under the category "Call For Fire Card".

[b]Known Issues[/b]
if ran with [LNX] Snipers Reference Card, the CBA keybinds and addon options will not be visible
